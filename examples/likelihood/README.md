# `likelihood` LAMP+ system

If I may, I would define this as an LAMP+ system, where the plus sign indicates the possibility of developing web applications with additional programming languages, in addition to the usual PHP, JavaScript and SQL.
Remembering that there are valid web frameworks also for programming languages â€‹Rust, Python and C/C++.
