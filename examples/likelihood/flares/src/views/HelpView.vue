      <h3>hypothesis: three spatial and two temporal dimensions</h3>
      <p>
        The five-dimensional field expands to the right in the horizontal time dimension as an object moves in three
        spatial dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The vertical time dimension turns out to be apparent time, while in the five-dimensional field time skews to the
        right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Too faster the object moves in three spatial dimensions, more the angle between the apparent temporal dimension
        and the horizontal temporal dimension decreases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, I can calculate the speed of the object moving in the five-dimensional field by knowing the value of
        the angle formed between the vertical and horizontal time dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, an object traveling at a speed close to that of light will have an angle close to zero and when
        observed in the apparent time dimension will appear practically motionless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Absurdly, one could say that the apparent temporal dimension corresponds to the mass of the observed object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said that, the purpose of this micro-frontend application is to support the thought experiment aimed at
        predicting the occurrence of probabilistic flares in a five-dimensional space.
