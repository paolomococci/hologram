# `posts-cheddar` web user interface application

This is a frontend web application developed thanks Vite, React an Tailwind CSS.

I am allowed to associate the front-end developed with certain frameworks with various cheeses or similar products.
I hope no one will have any trouble with this.
In the end, it is just a mnemonic association.

I only need it to remind me that a certain front-end, which interacts with a certain back-end, was developed using a certain framework.
There is nothing else.
