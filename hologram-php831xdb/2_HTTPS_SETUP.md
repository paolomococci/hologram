# https setup a self-signed certificate

## parameter for generate keys:

To generate a good passphrase I could use the following command:

```bash
pwgen -s 48 1
```

Here is just an example of the parameters to keep on hand:

```text
[long passphrase]
[national_acronym]
[state]
[city]
hologram-php831xdb.local
hologram-php831xdb.local
hologram-php831xdb.local
[webmaster@localhost]
```
