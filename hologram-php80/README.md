# hologram-php80

Based on some statistics, it seems that PHP version 8.0, together with 8.1 and 7.4, is among the most used.

Here are the procedures for obtaining a LAMP server stack with version 8.0 of PHP.

However, PHP version 8.0, being without support, I will proceed in order to obtain a development environment to migrate to version 8.3 of PHP.

At the end of the procedure you will obtain a migration stack LAMP with two virtual hosts, one with PHP version 8.0, the other with PHP version 8.3.
