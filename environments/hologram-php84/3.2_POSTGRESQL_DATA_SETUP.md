# data setup

## install MariaDB

```bash
su -
dnf install postgresql postgresql-contrib postgresql-server
```

## setup of MariaDB

```bash
updatedb
locate postgres | grep "/bin"
/usr/bin/postgresql-setup --help
/usr/bin/postgresql-setup --initdb
systemctl status postgresql
systemctl enable postgresql
systemctl start postgresql
systemctl status postgresql
```
## add new user

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

In the `psql` console:

```sql
CREATE USER developer_username WITH CREATEDB LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
```

The following command is used to obtain information about RDBMS users:

```console
\du+
```

to then create the databases for the developer user:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE developer_username WITH OWNER developer_username;
```

The following command is used to obtain a list of databases present in the system:

```console
\l
```

this to change working database:

```console
\c developer_username_db
```

The following command is useful for getting help on how to use the console:

```console
\?
```

and the following command is used to return to the shell:

```console
\q
```

Now it's time to log in with the newly created account:

```bash
psql -U developer_username
```

## allow access to the RDBMS from the network

You need to edit the files `pg_hba.conf` and `postgresql.conf`.

```bash
su -
updatedb
locate pg_hba.conf
```

Edit `pg_hba.conf`:

```bash
nano /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
```

At the end of file type:

```text
host    all     developer_username   192.168.1.0/24        md5
```

```bash
locate postgresql.conf
```

Edit `pg_hba.conf`:

```bash
nano /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf
```

```text
listen_addresses = '*'
```

After that, you need to restart the service:

```bash
systemctl restart postgresql
systemctl status postgresql
```

and check its work:

```bash
netstat -nlp | grep "5432"
```

you should get feedback similar to the following:

```text
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5432            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1449/postgres       
tcp6       0      0 :::5432                 :::*                    LISTEN      1449/postgres       
unix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     27246    1449/postgres        /var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432
```

It's time to open the door to the rest of the internal network:

```bash
netstat -tln
netstat -nlp | grep "5432"
```

### check

Here is a command to try on the client workstation with root credentials:

```bash
nmap -Pn 192.168.1.XXX -p 5432
```
