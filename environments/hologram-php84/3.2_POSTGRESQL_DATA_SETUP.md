# PostgreSQL data setup

I added the possibility of using PostgreSQL for its mature integration with the unstructured data support.
In addition, of course, to the structured one, so as to leave me more possibilities for mixed development.

## install PostgreSQL

```bash
su -
dnf install postgresql postgresql-contrib postgresql-server
```

## setup of PostgreSQL

```bash
updatedb
locate postgres | grep "/bin"
/usr/bin/postgresql-setup --help
/usr/bin/postgresql-setup --initdb
systemctl status postgresql
systemctl enable postgresql
systemctl start postgresql
systemctl status postgresql
```
## add new user

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

In the `psql` console:

```sql
CREATE USER developer_username WITH CREATEDB LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
```

The following command is used to obtain information about RDBMS users:

```console
\du+
```

to then create the databases for the developer user:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE developer_username WITH OWNER developer_username;
```

The following command is used to obtain a list of databases present in the system:

```console
\l
```

this to change working database:

```console
\c developer_username_db
```

The following command is useful for getting help on how to use the console:

```console
\?
```

and the following command is used to return to the shell:

```console
\q
```

Now it's time to log in with the newly created account:

```bash
psql -U developer_username
```

## allow access to the RDBMS from the network

You need to edit the files `pg_hba.conf` and `postgresql.conf`.

```bash
su -
updatedb
locate pg_hba.conf
```

Edit `pg_hba.conf`:

```bash
nano /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
```

At the end of file type:

```text
# TYPE      DATABASE        USER                ADDRESS                 METHOD
host        all         developer_username   192.168.1.0/24             md5
```

```bash
locate postgresql.conf
```

Edit `pg_hba.conf`:

```bash
nano /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf
```

```text
listen_addresses = '*'
```

After that, you need to restart the service:

```bash
systemctl restart postgresql
systemctl status postgresql
```

and check its work:

```bash
netstat -nlp | grep "5432"
```

you should get feedback similar to the following:

```text
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5432            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1322/postmaster     
tcp6       0      0 :::5432                 :::*                    LISTEN      1322/postmaster     
unix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     33676    1322/postmaster      /tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432
unix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     13943    1322/postmaster      /var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432
```

It's time to open the door to the rest of the internal network:

```bash
netstat -tln
netstat -nlp | grep "5432"
```

### check

Here is a command to try on the client workstation with root credentials:

```bash
nmap -Pn 192.168.1.XXX -p 5432
```

## connect remotely using the shell

Once you have verified connectivity as described above, you can connect by typing, for example, something similar to the following:

```bash
psql --host=192.168.1.XXX --port=5432 --username=developer_username
```
