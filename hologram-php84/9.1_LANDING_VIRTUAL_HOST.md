# `landing` virtual host setup

### parameter for generate keys:

Here is just an example of the parameters to keep on hand:

```text
[national_acronym]
[state]
[city]
landing-php84.local
landing-php84.local
landing-php84.local
[webmaster@localhost]
```

It is obvious that the first three parameters must be appropriately valued.

Therefore I can proceed with the generation of the self-signed certificate without the passphrase thanks to the `-nodes` flag:

```bash
su -
ls -al /etc/ssl/
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/landing-php84.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/landing-php84.crt
ls -al /etc/ssl/private/
ls -al /etc/ssl/certs/
```

### file `/etc/httpd/conf.d/landing-php84.local.conf`

```bash
nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/landing-php84.local.conf
```

```xml
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        ServerName landing-php84.local
        ServerAlias www.landing-php84.local
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/landing/public
        Redirect permanent "/" "https://landing-php84.local/"
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        ServerName landing-php84.local
        ServerAlias www.landing-php84.local
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/landing/public

        <Directory /var/www/html/landing/public>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride All
                Require all granted
        </Directory>

        SSLEngine on

        SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/landing-php84.crt
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/landing-php84.key

        ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/landing-php84_error_log

        <FilesMatch "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$">
                SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
        </FilesMatch>
</VirtualHost>
```

### application scaffolding

With developer user credentials:

```bash
sudo apachectl configtest
cd /var/www/html/
composer list
composer create-project laravel/laravel landing
sudo apachectl configtest
sudo systemctl reload httpd
systemctl status httpd --no-pager
cd landing/
```

If I encounter any problems I can investigate with the following command:

```bash
journalctl -u httpd --since today --no-pager
```

### solution of `failed to open stream: permission denied`

```bash
stat -c %a bootstrap/cache
find bootstrap/cache -printf '%m %p \n'
find storage -printf '%m %p \n'
find database -printf '%m %p \n'
chmod --recursive 775 bootstrap/cache && chmod --recursive 775 storage && chmod --recursive 775 database
chown --recursive developer_username:apache .
```

### continuation of scaffolding

```bash
composer require laravel/jetstream
php artisan jetstream:install livewire --teams --dark
npm install
npm run build
php artisan migrate:status
```

### to improve the development of `Livewire` components

```bash
composer require wire-elements/wire-spy --dev
```

### fix coding stile with `pint`

```bash
./vendor/bin/pint --help
./vendor/bin/pint --test
./vendor/bin/pint
```

## install Pest

```bash
composer require --dev --with-all-dependencies pestphp/pest
./vendor/bin/pest --init
composer require --dev pestphp/pest-plugin-laravel
```

### migrate all tests from PHPUnit to Pest

```bash
composer require --dev pestphp/pest-plugin-drift
./vendor/bin/pest --help
./vendor/bin/pest --drift
```

### run all the tests

Please, pay attention, to verify the validity of the texts with the `--coverage` option, it is necessary to have appropriately modified the `php.ini` file with, for example, a line similar to the following:

```ini
xdebug.mode=develop,debug,trace,coverage
```

```bash
php artisan test --coverage
```

## how to check installed packages

```bash
composer show --help
composer show
composer show --tree
composer show | grep laravel
composer show | grep pest
```

## how to check licenses of installed packages

```bash
composer require --dev dominikb/composer-license-checker
./vendor/bin/composer-license-checker help
./vendor/bin/composer-license-checker list
./vendor/bin/composer-license-checker check
./vendor/bin/composer-license-checker report
```

## commands that may prove useful

```bash
composer suggest --all
```

To diagnose any problems:

```bash
composer --help diagnose
composer diagnose
```

## how to create a new testing class with Pest

```bash
php artisan make:test --help
```

### `web` routes example test

```bash
php artisan make:test --pest WelcomeFeatureTest
```

```php
<?php

test('welcome feature test', function () {
    $response = $this->get('/');

    $response->assertStatus(200);
});
```

```bash
php artisan test --filter WelcomeFeatureTest
```

## update dependencies to the latest version

```bash
composer update --help
composer update --ignore-platform-reqs
```

## only if it is necessary to reset the entire database

```bash
php artisan db:wipe
php artisan migrate:fresh
php artisan migrate:status
php artisan db:seed
```

### only if I need to go back to the previous migration

```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback
```

## I have to remember to issue the following commands when I add a new route and it is not listed:

```bash
npm run build
chmod --recursive 775 bootstrap/cache
chmod --recursive 775 storage
chmod --recursive 775 database
chown --recursive developer_username:apache .
php artisan route:cache && php artisan route:clear && php artisan route:list
```

and, if I am examining the presence of a specific route, the following command has been useful to me:

```bash
php artisan route:list | grep "help"
```

## to get inspired to write custom commands

```bash
php artisan inspire
```

## a library for generate SVG charts

```bash
composer require maantje/charts
```

## libraries for processing typical office documents

Documents such as spreadsheets, text documents, and documents suitable for printing:

```bash
composer require tecnickcom/tc-lib-pdf
composer require phpoffice/phpspreadsheet
composer require phpoffice/phpword
```

Finally, a further check on the licenses of the packages installed in the web application:

```bash
./vendor/bin/composer-license-checker report
```
