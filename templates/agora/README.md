# `agora`

In this template I would like to highlight the flexibility offered by various open source frameworks that can be used to initially create a development environment that is completely controlled by the developer or team of developers.

The thing that interests me most about an in-house development environment is the prospect of having production applications on premise, so that I can get the maximum confidentiality from them.

Furthermore, to achieve this goal I can separate the applications into backend and frontend and use different open source technologies to obtain a flexible and interchangeable environment.
