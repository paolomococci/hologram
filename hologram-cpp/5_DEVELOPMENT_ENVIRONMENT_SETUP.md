# development environment set-up

To be concise, given that I have dedicated this repository to the development of web applications in the PHP language, I recommend Oat++ as a framework for the back-end and Vue.js as a framework for the front-end.

Documentation and examples are present on the websites of the respective projects.

Finally, I would like to add that with these two frameworks it is possible to develop software architectures with the micro-services model on the server side and web micro-frontend side.
