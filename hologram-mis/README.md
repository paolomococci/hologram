# hologram-mis (Management Information Systems)

Looking ahead, I am preparing a set of procedures to build the backbone of a local CaaS, (Container as a Service), example.
A type of CaaS in `on premise` configuration thanks to a virtual server with GNU/Linux Debian 12, `bookworm`, installed.
For data persistence and the development of the backend and frontend application code deployed in different containers I will use volumes present in a local NFS server.

It is good to remember that the link addresses mentioned in the procedures may change.
The procedures themselves may change or there may be more convenient ones.
Therefore, it is always necessary to refer to the official documentation hosted on the sites of the programming languages, servers and tools mentioned from time to time.
Thank you.
