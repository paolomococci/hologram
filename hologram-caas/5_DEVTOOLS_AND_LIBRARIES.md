# development tools and libraries setup

I will need the following packages:

* build-essential
* python3
* python3-pip

With the following command I can check if the package is already installed:

```bash
dpkg -l build-essential
```

To then proceed with installing the packages that are not yet present on the system.

As follows, for example only:

```bash
apt update  
apt install build-essential python3-pip
```
