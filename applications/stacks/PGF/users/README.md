# Users, PGF full-stack application

PGF stands for PostgreSQL, Go and Flutter.

So the stack I'm going to present uses PostgreSQL as the database server, Go as the back-end programming language, and Flutter as the front-end framework, with the programming language Dart.

Furthermore, if you prefer to adopt Dart as your only programming language, perhaps because it is well known by the entire development team, you can also use it for back-end development.

Last but not least, it is necessary to mention the glue that will hold everything together, that is, Docker, or, if you prefer because it already integrates the orchestration, Podman.

At this point, we can't help but mention the backbone of the entire system: GNU/Linux!
In my opinion, the two creators, for the benefit they have offered humanity, are well-deserved to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Of course, some might argue that theirs is not a political initiative, but the decidedly peaceful and democratic impact of their initiatives is equally undeniable.
